# Typing Speed Test - Blind Mode Best Score Separation

**App:** Typing Speed Test  
**Date:** 2025-07-27  
**Estimated Complexity:** 1-2 hours (experienced developer)  

## Original Request

> the best scores should be saved differently for blind mode also, so the blind mode status should be included on the key that is being used, if no blind mode keep the old key for keeping compatibility, if on then add that to the key so the best score is saved separetely

## Current Implementation Analysis

The typing speed test app currently uses the following storage key pattern for best scores:
```javascript
const storageKey = `typing-best-wpm-${this.selectedDictionary}`;
```

This key is used in three functions:
- `loadBestScore()` - line 994
- `saveBestScore()` - line 1006  
- `resetBestScore()` - line 1584

The app has blind mode functionality (`this.blindMode` and `this.blindModeSelected` properties) but currently doesn't differentiate best scores between normal and blind modes.

## Specification

### Requirements

1. **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain existing storage key format when blind mode is disabled
2. **Separate Tracking**: Track best scores separately for blind mode vs normal mode
3. **Immediate Updates**: When toggling blind mode, immediately show the correct best score for that mode
4. **Dictionary Compatibility**: Work with existing dictionary-based score separation

### Implementation Details

#### Storage Key Logic
- **Normal Mode (blind mode off)**: `typing-best-wpm-${this.selectedDictionary}`
- **Blind Mode (blind mode on)**: `typing-best-wpm-${this.selectedDictionary}-blind`

#### Function Modifications

1. **Create Helper Function**
   ```javascript
   getBestScoreStorageKey() {
       const baseKey = `typing-best-wpm-${this.selectedDictionary}`;
       return this.blindModeSelected ? `${baseKey}-blind` : baseKey;
   }
   ```

2. **Update loadBestScore()**
   - Replace hardcoded key with `this.getBestScoreStorageKey()`
   - Call when blind mode is toggled to load correct score immediately

3. **Update saveBestScore()**
   - Replace hardcoded key with `this.getBestScoreStorageKey()`

4. **Update resetBestScore()**
   - Replace hardcoded key with `this.getBestScoreStorageKey()`

5. **Update toggleBlindMode()**
   - Call `this.loadBestScore()` after toggling to immediately show correct best score

### User Experience Impact

- **Seamless Transition**: When user toggles blind mode, best score display updates immediately
- **Mode-Specific Goals**: Users can track separate progress for blind vs normal typing
- **No Data Loss**: Existing best scores remain intact and accessible
- **Visual Feedback**: Best score in UI reflects the current mode's achievement

### Technical Considerations

- Uses existing IndexedDB infrastructure
- Minimal code changes required
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Storage keys remain human-readable for debugging

### Testing Requirements

1. Verify normal mode uses original key format
2. Verify blind mode uses extended key format  
3. Test toggling between modes updates best score display
4. Verify backwards compatibility with existing scores
5. Test with multiple dictionaries in both modes

## Implementation Summary

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date:** 2025-07-27  
**Implementation Time:** ~2 hours  

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Process

**Stage 1: Test Creation & Initial Implementation**
- Created comprehensive test suite with 9 test cases covering all requirements
- Tests initially failed as expected (TDD red phase)
- Implemented core functionality to make tests pass (TDD green phase)

**Stage 2: Code Refactoring**
- Code was already clean and well-structured, no major refactoring needed
- No dead code or security issues identified
- All existing tests continued to pass

### Implementation Details

**Changes Made:**
1. **Added `getBestScoreStorageKey()` helper function** - Returns correct storage key based on blind mode state
2. **Updated `loadBestScore()` function** - Now uses helper function for correct key
3. **Updated `saveBestScore()` function** - Now uses helper function for correct key  
4. **Updated `resetBestScore()` function** - Now uses helper function for correct key
5. **Enhanced `toggleBlindMode()` function** - Now loads correct best score after mode toggle
6. **Exposed IndexedDB functions to window** - For test accessibility
7. **Updated JavaScript cache-busting version** - From v2025-07-27.1 to v2025-07-27.2

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Used `-blind` suffix for blind mode storage keys (backwards compatible)
- Maintained original key format for normal mode (backwards compatible)
- Called `loadBestScore()` in `toggleBlindMode()` for immediate UI update
- Exposed IndexedDB functions to window object for test access

**Testing Statistics:**
- **Total tests created:** 9 comprehensive test cases
- **Test rounds needed:** 2 (initial failures due to missing functions, then all pass)
- **Refactoring rounds:** 0 (code was clean from start)
- **Security issues found:** 0

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Storage key generation for both modes
- ✅ Backwards compatibility with existing scores
- ✅ Separate tracking between modes  
- ✅ UI updates when toggling modes
- ✅ Mode-specific save operations
- ✅ Mode-specific reset operations
- ✅ Multiple dictionary compatibility
- ✅ First-time user scenarios

**Estimated Development Time for Experienced Developer:** 1-2 hours
- Requirements analysis: 15 minutes
- Test creation: 45 minutes  
- Implementation: 30 minutes
- Testing & validation: 15 minutes
- Documentation: 15 minutes

### User Experience Impact

Users can now:
- Track separate best scores for blind mode vs normal mode
- See immediate best score updates when toggling blind mode
- Maintain existing best scores (backwards compatible)
- Reset scores individually per mode
- Use feature across all available dictionaries

The implementation maintains full backwards compatibility while providing the requested mode-specific tracking functionality.
